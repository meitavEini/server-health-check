Hey Upper East Siders, Gossip Girl here.
Ever wondered if your server is about to totally flop at the Met Gala of production environments? Or if your CPU is throwing shade behind your back?

Don’t worry, darlings. I’ve got you covered.

👠 What is this?
A fabulous one-click bash script that checks if your server is living its best life — or about to pull a Little J meltdown.
It checks:

CPU usage (is it working too hard? Poor thing 💔)

Memory usage (low on memory? Someone call Blair.)

Disk usage (we need space for all those secrets...)

The most dramatic processes hogging CPU and memory (hello, Serena-level drama 👀)

💣 Why?
Because, let’s be real, no one likes surprises — unless it’s a Chanel bag or an unexpected scandal.
With this script, you’ll always know who’s the Queen B and who needs to be banished from the server party.
